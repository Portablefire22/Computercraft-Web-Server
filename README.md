# Missing Textures?

By default, the `public/textures` folder is missing. 
This is due to the textures being the official minecraft textures.

## Obtaining Textures

To start with obtaining the minecraft textures, first locate the minecraft .jar
Information on finding the jar file can be found below.

### Windows

Located in `C:\Users\${USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\versions`

### Linux 

Located in `~/.minecraft/versions`

## Extracting textures

Locate the jar file you wish to use (this may be the most recent version or the version you are playing), and open the jar file with a file explorer. 
The texture folder can then be located in `assets/minecraft`.
